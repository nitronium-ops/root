The Daily Attendance Task is an automated background process in the Root system that runs at a scheduled time each day to manage attendance-related database operations. This page documents the implementation, scheduling, and execution of this task, which is responsible for creating daily attendance records and updating attendance summaries for all registered members.

For information about attendance security mechanisms, see [Attendance Security](/nitronium-ops/root/5.2-attendance-security).

## Purpose and Overview

The Daily Attendance Task serves two primary functions:

1. **Creating Daily Attendance Records**: Generates new attendance records for all members at the start of each day with default values (marked as absent initially).
2. **Updating Monthly Attendance Summaries**: Updates the monthly attendance summary for members who were present the previous day.

These automated operations ensure consistent attendance tracking even without manual intervention and prepare the system for the day's attendance marking operations.

## Scheduling Mechanism

The Daily Attendance Task is scheduled to run at 00:30 IST (India Standard Time, which is the same as Kolkata timezone). This timing ensures that the system creates new attendance records and updates summaries shortly after midnight when the day changes.

The task is implemented as an infinite loop that:

1. Calculates the time until the next execution (00:30 IST)
2. Sleeps until that time
3. Executes the daily task
4. Repeats

## Implementation Details

### Task Initialization

The Daily Attendance Task is initialized in the application's main function. It runs as a separate Tokio task, ensuring that it doesn't block the main application thread.

```
tokio::task::spawn(async {
    run_daily_task_at_midnight(pool).await;
});

```

Sources: [src/main.rs48-50](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L48-L50)

### Task Components

The Daily Attendance Task consists of several functions that work together to perform the required operations:

1. **`run_daily_task_at_midnight`**: The entry point that schedules and triggers the task execution
2. **`execute_daily_task`**: Coordinates the overall task execution
3. **`update_attendance`**: Creates daily attendance records for all members
4. **`update_attendance_summary`**: Checks yesterday's attendance and updates monthly summaries
5. **`update_days_attended`**: Updates the days\_attended counter in the AttendanceSummary table

Sources: [src/daily\_task/mod.rs10-202](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/daily_task/mod.rs#L10-L202)

## Creating Daily Attendance Records

For each member in the system, the Daily Attendance Task creates a new attendance record for the current day with default values:

* **is\_present**: `false` (member is marked absent by default)
* **time\_in**: `NULL` (no check-in time recorded)
* **time\_out**: `NULL` (no check-out time recorded)

The SQL query uses an `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` clause to avoid duplicate entries if the record already exists.

```
INSERT INTO Attendance (member_id, date, is_present, time_in, time_out) 
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
ON CONFLICT (member_id, date) DO NOTHING

```

Sources: [src/daily\_task/mod.rs53-93](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/daily_task/mod.rs#L53-L93)

## Updating Attendance Summaries

After creating the daily attendance records, the task updates the monthly attendance summaries for members who were present the previous day. This process:

1. Checks if a member was present yesterday
2. If present, increments their `days_attended` counter for the current month
3. Creates a new monthly summary record if one doesn't exist

Sources: [src/daily\_task/mod.rs95-202](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/daily_task/mod.rs#L95-L202)

## Database Interactions

The Daily Attendance Task interacts with three database tables:

| Table | Operation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Member | SELECT | Retrieve all registered members |
| Attendance | INSERT | Create new daily attendance records |
| Attendance | SELECT | Check if members were present yesterday |
| AttendanceSummary | SELECT | Check if monthly summary exists |
| AttendanceSummary | UPDATE | Increment days\_attended counter |
| AttendanceSummary | INSERT | Create new monthly summary records |

Sources: [src/daily\_task/mod.rs42-202](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/daily_task/mod.rs#L42-L202)

## Error Handling

The Daily Attendance Task includes error handling at several levels:

1. **Member Fetching**: If the query to fetch members fails, it logs the error but doesn't terminate the task.
2. **Attendance Record Creation**: If the insertion of an attendance record fails, it logs the error and continues with the next member.
3. **Summary Update**: Even if attendance record creation fails for a member, the task still attempts to update their attendance summary.

This approach ensures that the task continues running even if individual operations fail, maximizing data integrity.

## Integration with Other Systems

The Daily Attendance Task is designed to work with other systems in the Root ecosystem, particularly the Presense attendance system. By creating attendance records at the start of each day, it prepares the database for updates from Presense when members check in or out.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Timezone Handling**: The task explicitly uses the Kolkata timezone (UTC+5:30) to ensure consistent execution relative to Indian Standard Time.
2. **Concurrency**: The task runs in a separate Tokio task to avoid blocking the main application thread.
3. **Database Connection Pooling**: The task uses the same database connection pool as the rest of the application to efficiently manage database resources.
