This document describes the security mechanisms implemented in the Root GraphQL Backend to ensure the integrity and authenticity of attendance records. The attendance security system uses HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) with SHA-256 to verify that attendance marking requests come from authorized sources and have not been tampered with.

For information about the daily attendance task system, see [Daily Attendance Task](/nitronium-ops/root/5.1-daily-attendance-task).

## 1. HMAC Authentication Overview

The Root system uses an HMAC-based authentication scheme to secure the attendance marking process. This prevents unauthorized marking of attendance and ensures that attendance records cannot be falsified.

### HMAC Authentication Flow

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs19-62](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L19-L62)

## 2. HMAC Implementation Details

The Root system implements HMAC-SHA256 for signature verification. This cryptographic method ensures that attendance records can only be modified by authorized systems that possess the shared secret key.

### Key Components

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs1-13](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L1-L13) [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs14-63](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L14-L63)

### Signature Generation and Verification

The HMAC signature is generated using:

1. The secret key (ROOT\_SECRET)
2. A message consisting of the member ID and date concatenated

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs29-43](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L29-L43)

## 3. Attendance Marking Process

When a valid HMAC signature is provided, the system proceeds to mark attendance, updating the attendance record in the database.

### Attendance Update Logic

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs45-62](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L45-L62)

## 4. Database Constraints for Attendance Security

The database schema includes several constraints to maintain data integrity and prevent invalid attendance records.

### Attendance Table Constraints

The Attendance table includes the following security-related constraints:

| Constraint | Description | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHECK (is_present = TRUE AND time_in IS NOT NULL AND time_out IS NOT NULL) OR (is_present = FALSE AND time_in IS NULL AND time_out IS NULL)` | Ensures consistency between attendance status and time fields | Prevents inconsistent attendance records |
| `CHECK (is_present = FALSE OR date <= CURRENT_DATE)` | Prevents marking attendance for future dates | Prevents attendance fraud |
| `CHECK (time_out IS NULL OR time_out >= time_in)` | Ensures time\_out is not earlier than time\_in | Maintains chronological integrity |
| `UNIQUE (member_id, date)` | Ensures only one attendance record per member per day | Prevents duplicate attendance records |

## 5. Security Implementation Code

The core of the attendance security system is implemented in the `markAttendance` mutation, which verifies the HMAC signature before updating attendance records.

Key implementation details:

1. The secret key is retrieved from the GraphQL context
2. An HMAC-SHA256 instance is created with the secret key
3. The message (member\_id + date) is processed
4. The provided signature is compared against the expected signature
5. If signatures match, attendance is updated with current time

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs29-43](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L29-L43)

## 6. Best Practices and Considerations

To maintain the security of the attendance system, consider the following best practices:

1. **Secret Management**: Ensure the ROOT\_SECRET is securely stored and not exposed in client-side code
2. **Clock Synchronization**: Ensure server and client clocks are reasonably synchronized
3. **Replay Prevention**: Consider implementing additional measures to prevent replay attacks
4. **Regular Key Rotation**: Periodically rotate the secret key
5. **Audit Logging**: Implement detailed logging for attendance marking attempts

## 7. Integration with Client Applications

Client applications must implement the same HMAC algorithm to generate valid signatures when marking attendance.

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs19-62](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L19-L62)

## 8. Technical Details

The attendance security system relies on the following dependencies:

* `hmac` (v0.12.1): Provides HMAC implementation
* `sha2` (v0.10.8): Provides SHA-256 hashing algorithm
* `hex` (v0.4.3): Provides hex encoding/decoding

The HMAC-SHA256 implementation is used to ensure that attendance marking requests are authenticated and have not been tampered with.
