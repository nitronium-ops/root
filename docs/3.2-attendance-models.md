This document details the attendance tracking data models in the Root GraphQL Backend system. It covers the core attendance records, monthly summary data, and related data structures used throughout the attendance tracking subsystem. For information about the automated processes that use these models, see [Attendance System](/nitronium-ops/root/5-attendance-system) and [Daily Attendance Task](/nitronium-ops/root/5.1-daily-attendance-task).

## Overview

The attendance system tracks daily presence records for each member and maintains monthly attendance summaries. Two primary models form the foundation of this system:

1. **Attendance** - Tracks daily attendance records with time information
2. **AttendanceSummary** - Aggregates monthly attendance statistics

## Core Models

### Attendance

The `Attendance` model represents a daily attendance record for a specific member. Each record contains information about whether the member was present on a given date and, if so, when they checked in and out.

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attendance_id` | `i32` | Primary key, auto-incremented unique identifier |
| `member_id` | `i32` | Foreign key reference to the Member table |
| `date` | `NaiveDate` | Calendar date of the attendance record |
| `is_present` | `bool` | Boolean flag indicating if the member was present |
| `time_in` | `Option<NaiveTime>` | First recorded check-in time (optional) |
| `time_out` | `Option<NaiveTime>` | Last recorded check-out time (optional) |
| `created_at` | `NaiveDateTime` | Timestamp when the record was created |
| `updated_at` | `NaiveDateTime` | Timestamp when the record was last updated |

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs5-17](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L5-L17) [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql21-37](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L21-L37)

#### Database Constraints

The `Attendance` table has several important constraints:

1. **Present/Absent Validation**: If a member is marked present, both `time_in` and `time_out` must be non-null; if absent, both must be null
2. **Date Validation**: A member can only be marked present for dates up to the current date (no future attendance)
3. **Time Order Check**: The `time_out` must be equal to or later than `time_in`
4. **Unique Constraint**: Each member can have only one attendance record per date

The table also uses a trigger to automatically update the `updated_at` timestamp whenever a record is modified.

### AttendanceSummary

The `AttendanceSummary` model provides aggregated monthly attendance statistics for members. This summary model enables efficient querying of attendance metrics without recounting daily records.

#### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `member_id` | `i32` | Foreign key reference to the Member table |
| `year` | `i32` | Calendar year of the summary |
| `month` | `i32` | Calendar month of the summary (1-12) |
| `days_attended` | `i32` | Count of days the member was present in the given month |

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs19-25](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L19-L25) [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql53-59](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L53-L59)

#### Composite Primary Key

The `AttendanceSummary` table uses a composite primary key consisting of (`member_id`, `year`, `month`), ensuring that each member has at most one summary record per month.

## Supplementary Models

### AttendanceInfo

`AttendanceInfo` is a simplified projection of the `Attendance` model, omitting the IDs and metadata fields. It's typically used when returning attendance data as part of other queries.

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs27-33](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L27-L33)

### AttendanceSummaryInfo

Similarly, `AttendanceSummaryInfo` provides a simplified view of the `AttendanceSummary` model without the member reference.

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs35-40](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L35-L40)

### MarkAttendanceInput

`MarkAttendanceInput` is an input type used for the attendance marking mutation. It includes an HMAC signature for security validation.

This input model facilitates secure attendance marking through the GraphQL API. The `hmac_signature` field contains a cryptographic signature that helps prevent unauthorized attendance entries.

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs42-47](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L42-L47) [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs19-62](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L19-L62)

### AttendanceWithMember

`AttendanceWithMember` combines attendance data with essential member information, useful for reporting queries that require both attendance details and member context.

Sources: [src/models/attendance.rs49-59](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/attendance.rs#L49-L59)

## Attendance Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates how attendance data flows through the system:

## Database Schema and Constraints

The database implementation enforces several important constraints:

1. **Data Integrity**:

   * `Attendance` records are linked to `Member` records via foreign key constraints with cascading deletion
   * The `AttendanceSummary` has a similar foreign key link to `Member`
2. **Validation Rules**:

   * An attendance record is valid only when it correctly represents present or absent states
   * Time entries must be chronologically valid (time\_out >= time\_in)
   * A member can have only one attendance record per date
3. **Automation**:

   * The `updated_at` field is automatically maintained via a database trigger

Sources: [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql6-59](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L6-L59)

## Integration with GraphQL API

The attendance models are exposed through the GraphQL API, which provides mutations for marking attendance and queries for retrieving attendance data.

The primary mutation for attendance marking is `markAttendance`, which:

1. Takes a `MarkAttendanceInput` with member ID, date, and HMAC signature
2. Verifies the HMAC signature using the system's secret key
3. Updates the corresponding attendance record, setting `is_present` to true and updating time fields
4. Returns the updated `Attendance` record

This mutation uses the current time in the Kolkata timezone when updating attendance records, ensuring consistent time-based tracking regardless of the server's local time.

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/attendance\_mutations.rs17-62](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/attendance_mutations.rs#L17-L62)

## Integration with Other Subsystems

The attendance models integrate with other parts of the system:

1. **Member Records**: Each attendance record is associated with a member through the `member_id` foreign key
2. **Daily Task System**: Creates attendance records and updates summary statistics
3. **Security System**: Uses HMAC verification to secure attendance marking

For detailed information about these integrations, see [Member Model](/nitronium-ops/root/3.1-member-model), [Daily Attendance Task](/nitronium-ops/root/5.1-daily-attendance-task), and [Attendance Security](/nitronium-ops/root/5.2-attendance-security).
