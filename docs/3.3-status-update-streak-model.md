## Purpose and Scope

The Status Update Streak Model is responsible for tracking consecutive status updates made by members in the Root system. It provides a gamification element by recording both the current streak and maximum streak achieved by each member. This document details the data structure, database representation, and operations related to the Status Update Streak functionality.

For information about member data, see [Member Model](/nitronium-ops/root/3.1-member-model). For attendance tracking, see [Attendance Models](/nitronium-ops/root/3.2-attendance-models).

## Data Model

The Status Update Streak model maintains a record of consecutive status updates for each member in the system. It is implemented as a simple table with three fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| member\_id | i32 | Foreign key referencing the Member table |
| current\_streak | i32 | The current consecutive streak count |
| max\_streak | i32 | The highest streak count ever achieved |

The model uses the `member_id` as the primary key, allowing only one streak record per member.

## Model Implementation

The Status Update Streak model is implemented using Rust structs with appropriate traits for GraphQL and database operations.

### Core Structs

The system defines several structs to represent streak data:

1. **StatusUpdateStreak**: The primary model representing the database table
2. **StatusUpdateStreakInfo**: A view of streak data without the member ID (for GraphQL responses)
3. **StreakInput**: An input object for GraphQL mutations

Sources: [src/models/status\_update\_streak.rs1-20](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/status_update_streak.rs#L1-L20)

## Streak Operations

The system provides two primary operations for streak management:

1. **Increment Streak**: Increases a member's current streak by 1 and updates the max\_streak if necessary
2. **Reset Streak**: Resets or decrements a member's current streak when they miss an update

### Increment Streak

When a member makes a status update, their streak is incremented using the following logic:

1. If no streak record exists for the member, create one with current\_streak = 1 and max\_streak = 1
2. If a streak record exists:
   * If current\_streak ≥ 0, increment it by 1
   * If current\_streak < 0, set it to 1
   * Update max\_streak if the new current\_streak is greater than the previous max\_streak

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/streak\_mutations.rs13-34](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/streak_mutations.rs#L13-L34)

### Reset Streak

When a member misses an update, their streak can be reset using the following logic:

1. If no streak record exists for the member, create one with current\_streak = 0 and max\_streak = 0
2. If a streak record exists:
   * If current\_streak > 0, set it to 0
   * If current\_streak ≤ 0, decrement it by 1 (allowing negative streaks to track consecutive missed updates)

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/streak\_mutations.rs36-54](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/streak_mutations.rs#L36-L54)

## Database Implementation

The status update streak data is stored in the `StatusUpdateStreak` table with the `member_id` as the primary key. The table operations use SQL upsert patterns to handle both insertions and updates with a single query.

### Increment Streak SQL

### Reset Streak SQL

## Integration with GraphQL API

The Status Update Streak functionality is exposed through the GraphQL API with specific mutations for increment and reset operations.

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/streak\_mutations.rs8-55](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/streak_mutations.rs#L8-L55)

## Usage Patterns

The Status Update Streak model is designed to support gamification features in the system:

1. **Regular Updates**: Members are encouraged to make regular status updates to increase their streak.
2. **Streak Visibility**: The current and maximum streaks can be displayed to members to motivate consistent participation.
3. **Streak Badges**: The system could implement badges or achievements based on streak milestones.
4. **Negative Streaks**: The ability to track negative streaks allows the system to identify members who consistently miss updates.

## Data Relationship Context

The Status Update Streak is a member-centric feature that extends the core Member model. Here's how it fits into the broader data model:
