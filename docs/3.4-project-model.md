This page documents the Project data model within the Root GraphQL backend system. The Project model represents individual projects associated with club members. For information about other data models in the system, see [Data Models](/nitronium-ops/root/3-data-models).

## Overview

The Project model provides a way to associate project information with club members. Each project belongs to exactly one member, while a member can have multiple projects. Projects are a core part of the system's data structure, allowing for tracking and managing member's projects.

Sources: [migrations/20250124095543\_create\_project\_table.sql](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250124095543_create_project_table.sql) [src/models/project.rs](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/project.rs)

## Data Structure

The Project model is defined in the system as a Rust struct with corresponding database representation.

### Model Definition

```
Project {
    project_id: i32,       // Primary key
    member_id: i32,        // Foreign key to Member table
    title: Option<String>, // Optional project title
}

```

The Project struct is decorated with `FromRow` for database deserialization and `SimpleObject` for GraphQL schema generation:

Sources: [src/models/project.rs4-9](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/project.rs#L4-L9)

### Database Schema

The Project model is stored in the PostgreSQL database in a table defined by:

Key characteristics:

* `project_id` is an auto-incrementing primary key
* `member_id` is a required foreign key referencing the Member table
* `title` is an optional text field storing the project's name/description
* Projects are automatically deleted when their associated member is deleted (CASCADE)

### Input Type

For creating new projects, a `SetProjectInput` type is defined:

```
SetProjectInput {
    member_id: i32,
    title: String,
}

```

This input type is used by the GraphQL mutation for creating projects.

## Project Model Architecture

The following diagram illustrates how the Project model fits into the system architecture:

## GraphQL Operations

The Project model can be accessed and manipulated through the GraphQL API using the following operations:

### Queries

#### Get All Projects

Retrieves all projects from the database:

Implementation:

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/project\_queries.rs11-21](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/project_queries.rs#L11-L21)

#### Get Projects for a Specific Member

Projects can be accessed through the member they belong to:

Implementation:

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs85-93](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L85-L93)

### Mutations

#### Create a New Project

Creates a new project associated with a specified member:

Implementation:

**Note**: There appears to be a discrepancy in the implementation. The SQL query uses `project_title` as the column name, but the database schema defines the column as `title`. This may cause issues in production.

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/project\_mutations.rs13-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/project_mutations.rs#L13-L27)

## Related Components

The Project model interacts with these system components:

1. **Member Model**: Projects are associated with members through a foreign key relationship. For more details, see [Member Model](/nitronium-ops/root/3.1-member-model).
2. **GraphQL Schema**: Projects are exposed through the GraphQL API as both direct queries and as nested fields on Member objects.

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/mod.rs3-8](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/mod.rs#L3-L8) [src/graphql/mutations/mod.rs3-8](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/mod.rs#L3-L8)

## Limitations

The current implementation has some notable limitations:

1. No mutation is provided for updating or deleting existing projects
2. There's a potential discrepancy between the column name in the SQL query (`project_title`) and the actual schema (`title`)
3. Projects have minimal metadata - only a title with no additional fields for dates, status, descriptions, etc.

These limitations may need to be addressed in future development to enhance the functionality of the Project model.
