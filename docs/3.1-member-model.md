This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Member model in the Root GraphQL backend system. It details the core data structure that represents club members, including its fields, database schema, relationships, and associated operations. For information about attendance tracking, see [Attendance Models](/nitronium-ops/root/3.2-attendance-models).

## Model Overview

The Member model represents an individual club member and serves as the central entity in the Root system. It contains essential information such as identification details, personal information, and system-specific identifiers.

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| member\_id | i32 | Unique identifier for the member | Primary key, auto-incremented |
| roll\_no | String | Academic roll number | Unique, not null |
| name | String | Full name of the member | Not null |
| email | String | Email address | Unique, not null |
| sex | Sex enum | Gender of the member (M, F, Other) | Not null |
| year | i32 | Academic year (1-4) | Between 1 and 4, not null |
| hostel | String | Member's hostel or residence | Not null |
| mac\_address | String | Device MAC address for attendance tracking | Unique, not null |
| discord\_id | String | Discord user identifier | Unique, not null |
| group\_id | i32 | Group assignment identifier | Not null |
| created\_at | NaiveDateTime | Timestamp when record was created | Default: current timestamp |

## Database Schema

The Member model is stored in the database as the `Member` table with the following SQL schema:

The database schema includes several constraints:

* Primary key on `member_id` field
* Unique constraints on `roll_no`, `email`, `mac_address`, and `discord_id` fields
* Check constraint ensuring `year` is between 1 and 4
* Not null constraints on essential fields

## Relationships with Other Models

The Member model serves as the central entity in the system and has one-to-many relationships with several other models:

These relationships are implemented through foreign key constraints in the database, where each related model references the `member_id` field of the Member table.

Sources: [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql21-36](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L21-L36) [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql53-59](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L53-L59) [migrations/20250114180047\_create\_tables.sql61-66](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250114180047_create_tables.sql#L61-L66)

## GraphQL Type Definitions

In the GraphQL API, the Member model is exposed as a SimpleObject with fields marked for inclusion or exclusion from the API:

Note that the `created_at` field is marked with `#[graphql(skip)]` directive, hiding it from the GraphQL API while remaining part of the database model.

Sources: [src/models/member.rs13-28](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/member.rs#L13-L28) [src/models/member.rs5-11](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/member.rs#L5-L11)

## Member Creation

Creating a new member is facilitated through a GraphQL mutation that accepts a `CreateMemberInput` object:

The `CreateMemberInput` struct defines all required fields for creating a member:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| roll\_no | String | Academic roll number |
| name | String | Full name of the member |
| email | String | Email address |
| sex | Sex | Gender enum value (M, F, Other) |
| year | i32 | Academic year (1-4) |
| hostel | String | Member's hostel or residence |
| mac\_address | String | Device MAC address |
| discord\_id | String | Discord user identifier |
| group\_id | i32 | Group assignment identifier |

## Implementation Notes

* The Member model uses a custom SQL enum type (`sex_type`) for the `sex` field, defined in the migrations
* A current timestamp is automatically set for the `created_at` field when a record is created
* The model implements both `SimpleObject` for GraphQL output and `FromRow` for database row mapping
* Foreign key constraints on related tables include `ON DELETE CASCADE`, ensuring that when a member is deleted, all related records are automatically removed

## System Context

The Member model serves as the foundation for the attendance tracking system and other functionality within the Root backend. Member records must be created before attendance can be tracked or status update streaks can be maintained.
