## Overview

This document details the GraphQL queries and mutations related to status update streaks in the Root system. Status update streaks track the consistency of member status updates, recording both the current consecutive streak and the maximum streak achieved. For information about other GraphQL operations, see [Member Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.1-member-queries-and-mutations) or [Attendance Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.2-attendance-queries-and-mutations).

## Data Model

The status update streak functionality is built around the `StatusUpdateStreak` model, which tracks streak information for each member.

The streak system tracks two key metrics:

* `current_streak`: The number of consecutive status updates a member has provided
* `max_streak`: The highest streak value achieved by the member

The `StreakInput` object is used as input for streak mutations, requiring only the member's ID.

## GraphQL Schema

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/streak\_queries.rs1-33](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/streak_queries.rs#L1-L33) [src/graphql/mutations/streak\_mutations.rs1-56](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/streak_mutations.rs#L1-L56)

## GraphQL Queries

The system provides two queries for accessing streak information:

### streak

Retrieves streak information for a specific member.

**Signature:**

**Implementation Details:**

* Queries the database for a single streak record matching the provided member\_id
* Returns the current and maximum streak values

**SQL Query:**

### streaks

Retrieves streak information for all members.

**Signature:**

**Implementation Details:**

* Queries the database for all streak records
* Returns a list of all streak entries with member\_id, current\_streak, and max\_streak

**SQL Query:**

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/streak\_queries.rs10-32](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/streak_queries.rs#L10-L32)

## GraphQL Mutations

The system provides two mutations for modifying streak information:

### incrementStreak

Increments a member's current streak and updates the maximum streak if necessary.

**Signature:**

**Implementation Details:**

* If no streak record exists for the member, creates a new one with `current_streak=1` and `max_streak=1`
* If a record exists, increments the current streak by 1 (if current\_streak is ≥ 0)
* Updates max\_streak if the new current\_streak value is greater
* Returns the updated streak record

**SQL Query:**

### resetStreak

Resets or decrements a member's current streak.

**Signature:**

**Implementation Details:**

* If no streak record exists for the member, creates a new one with `current_streak=0` and `max_streak=0`
* If a record exists and current\_streak > 0, sets current\_streak to 0
* If current\_streak is already ≤ 0, decrements it further (making it more negative)
* Returns the updated streak record

**SQL Query:**

## Operational Flow

## Usage Examples

### Query Examples

Retrieve streak information for a specific member:

Retrieve all streak records:

### Mutation Examples

Increment a member's streak:

Reset a member's streak:

## Integration with Member System

The streak system is designed to work in conjunction with the member management system. Each member can have at most one streak record, which is identified by the member's ID.

| Scenario | Current Streak Behavior | Max Streak Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Member provides a status update | Incremented by 1 if ≥ 0 | Updated if new current streak is higher |
| Member misses a status update | Reset to 0 if > 0, decremented if ≤ 0 | Unchanged |
| New member (no streak record) | Created with value 1 on first update | Created with value 1 on first update |

## Implementation Notes

1. The streak system uses SQL's `ON CONFLICT` clause to handle both insertion of new records and updates to existing ones in a single operation.
2. Negative streak values are possible when a member continues to miss status updates after their streak has been reset to 0.
3. The maximum streak is only updated when the current streak surpasses it, ensuring it truly represents the longest consecutive streak.
4. All operations return the full streak record after modification, allowing clients to immediately display updated information without additional queries.
