This page documents the continuous integration, continuous deployment, and release processes for the Root GraphQL backend. It covers the automated workflows used to ensure code quality, generate documentation, build Docker images, and create releases.

For information about Docker container setup and deployment specifics, see [Docker Deployment](/nitronium-ops/root/6.1-docker-deployment). For details on code quality checks and release management, see [Code Quality and Releases](/nitronium-ops/root/6.2-code-quality-and-releases).

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The Root system uses GitHub Actions to automate various tasks in the development workflow. These workflows help maintain code quality, generate documentation, and deploy the application.

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml) [.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml) [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml)

## Workflow Triggers

The CI/CD pipelines are triggered by different events in the development lifecycle:

| Trigger | Description | Workflows Activated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pull Request to `main` or `develop` | Code changes proposed | Lint (Clippy, Rustfmt) |
| Push to `main` | Code merged to main branch | Documentation Generation, Docker Build & Deploy |
| Push tag starting with `v*` | Version release | Release Generation |
| Manual trigger | User-initiated action | Documentation Generation, Docker Build & Deploy |

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml3-5](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml#L3-L5) [.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml3-7](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml#L3-L7) [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml3-6](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml#L3-L6)

## Linting and Code Quality

The linting workflow ensures code quality by running Clippy and Rustfmt checks on pull requests.

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml)

The lint workflow runs two parallel jobs:

1. **Clippy**: Rust's linter that catches common mistakes and improves code quality

   * Runs with `--all-features` flag to check all conditional code
   * Uses `-D warnings` flag to treat warnings as errors
2. **Rustfmt**: Rust's code formatter

   * Ensures consistent code style across the codebase
   * Fails if any formatting issues are found

This workflow helps maintain code quality standards and consistent formatting before code is merged.

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml7-39](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml#L7-L39)

## Documentation Generation

The documentation generation workflow creates and publishes technical documentation for the codebase.

Sources: [.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml)

This workflow uses the DeepWiki action (v1.1) to generate comprehensive documentation based on the codebase structure and content. The workflow requires write permissions to the repository contents to publish the generated documentation.

Sources: [.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml1-19](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml#L1-L19)

## Release Generation

The release workflow creates platform-specific binaries when a version tag is pushed.

Sources: [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml)

The release generation process:

1. Triggered when a tag matching pattern `v*` is pushed (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Builds binaries for multiple platforms in parallel:
   * Linux (x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
   * Windows (x86\_64-pc-windows-msvc)
   * macOS (aarch64-apple-darwin)
3. Strips debug symbols from Linux and macOS binaries
4. Packages binaries into platform-appropriate archive formats (.tar.gz for Linux/macOS, .zip for Windows)
5. Creates a GitHub release with the generated assets and automatic release notes

Sources: [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml10-85](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml#L10-L85)

## Dependency Management

The project uses Dependabot to automatically check for and create pull requests for outdated dependencies.

Sources: [.github/dependabot.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/dependabot.yml)

Dependabot is configured to:

* Check for Cargo dependency updates weekly
* Automatically create pull requests when updates are found
* These pull requests then go through the standard lint workflow to ensure the updates don't break anything

Sources: [.github/dependabot.yml1-7](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/dependabot.yml#L1-L7)

## Docker Deployment

Although the specific Docker deployment workflow files weren't provided in the source files, the system architecture diagrams indicate that Docker is used for deployment, with images pushed to GitHub Container Registry.

The Docker deployment likely includes:

1. Building a Docker image containing the compiled Rust application
2. Pushing the image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
3. Deploying the container to the production environment

## CI/CD Architecture Integration

The CI/CD processes integrate with the larger system architecture to ensure efficient development and deployment.

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml) [.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml) [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml)

## Summary

The Root system implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that:

1. **Ensures code quality** through automated linting and formatting checks
2. **Generates documentation** automatically when code is updated
3. **Creates releases** for multiple platforms when version tags are pushed
4. **Deploys the application** via Docker containers
5. **Keeps dependencies up-to-date** with Dependabot

This automated workflow reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and maintains high quality standards throughout the development lifecycle.
