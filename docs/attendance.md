# Attendance System

Track daily member attendance and generate monthly attendance summaries. The summaries are used for quick access to see how many days a member has attended in a specific month, used in the amD attendance report.

## Models

### Attendance
```rust
struct Attendance {
    attendance_id: i32,
    member_id: i32,
    date: NaiveDate,
    is_present: bool,
    time_in: Option<NaiveTime>,
    time_out: Option<NaiveTime>,
    created_at: NaiveDateTime,
    updated_at: NaiveDateTime,
}
```
The final two fields are not exposed in the interface for obvious reasons.

### AttendanceSummary
Monthly attendance summary for each member.
```rust
struct AttendanceSummary {
    member_id: i32,
    year: i32,
    month: i32,
    days_attended: i32,
}
```

## Queries

### Mark Attendance

```graphql

    markAttendance(
        input: {
            memberId: 1

    ) {
        attendanceId
        isPresent
        timeIn
        timeOut
    }

```
