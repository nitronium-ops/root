This page documents the detailed architecture of the Root GraphQL Backend system, focusing on the core components, their interactions, and the technical implementation. For information about setting up the project, see [Project Setup](/nitronium-ops/root/2-project-setup), and for details on the data models, see [Data Models](/nitronium-ops/root/3-data-models).

## Architectural Overview

The Root system is structured as a modern, layered Rust application with clear separation of concerns. At its core, it is a GraphQL API server built on Axum and async-graphql, with PostgreSQL as the database.

Sources: [src/main.rs1-140](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L1-L140) [src/routes.rs1-40](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/routes.rs#L1-L40) [src/graphql/mod.rs1-23](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mod.rs#L1-L23)

## System Initialization Flow

The application follows a structured initialization process controlled by the `main` function in `main.rs`.

Sources: [src/main.rs40-60](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L40-L60)

## Core Components

### API Layer

The API layer is built with Axum, a web framework for Rust, and provides GraphQL endpoint and an optional GraphiQL interface for development.

Sources: [src/routes.rs12-30](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/routes.rs#L12-L30)

The router setup is responsible for creating the appropriate HTTP routes:

1. `/` - The main GraphQL endpoint that accepts queries and mutations
2. `/graphiql` - A development-only route that provides a GraphQL IDE (only in development mode)

### GraphQL Schema Organization

The GraphQL schema combines domain-specific queries and mutations into unified root types.

Sources: [src/graphql/mod.rs8-22](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mod.rs#L8-L22) [src/main.rs118-126](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L118-L126)

The schema construction is done in the `build_graphql_schema` function, which:

1. Creates a new schema with Query and Mutation roots
2. Injects the database pool as schema data
3. Injects the secret key for HMAC verification as schema data
4. Finalizes the schema for use

### Database Layer

The database layer manages connections to PostgreSQL and ensures schema migrations are applied.

Sources: [src/main.rs102-116](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L102-L116)

Key aspects of the database setup:

* Uses connection pooling with 2-3 connections
* Runs migrations automatically at startup
* Wraps the connection pool in `Arc` for thread-safe sharing

### Daily Task System

The automated daily task system runs attendance-related operations at midnight.

Sources: [src/main.rs48-50](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L48-L50)

The daily task is spawned as a separate asynchronous task during application startup, ensuring it doesn't block the main application thread.

### Configuration Management

The application uses environment variables for configuration, managed through a dedicated `Config` struct.

Sources: [src/main.rs20-38](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L20-L38)

The configuration includes:

* Environment mode (development/production)
* Secret key for security operations
* Database connection URL
* Server port

### Security Features

The application implements security best practices including CORS protection and HMAC verification.

Sources: [src/main.rs128-139](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L128-L139)

CORS configuration limits:

* Allowed origins (specific domains)
* Allowed methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS)
* Allowed headers (any)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web Framework | Axum | Used for HTTP routing and middleware |
| GraphQL Engine | async-graphql | Schema definition and query execution |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Primary data store |
| Database Access | SQLx | Type-safe SQL operations |
| Logging | tracing | Structured logging with environment-specific configuration |
| Environment | dotenv | Environment variable management |
| Async Runtime | Tokio | Asynchronous task execution |
| CORS | tower-http | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies |

### Execution Environment Differences

The system behavior changes based on the environment:

**Development Environment:**

* GraphiQL playground enabled at `/graphiql`
* Verbose logging (trace level)
* Console and file logging

**Production Environment:**

* GraphiQL playground disabled
* Basic logging (info level)
* File-only logging to `root.log`

## System Integration Points

The Root Backend integrates with other systems and client applications through its GraphQL API.

The GraphQL API serves as the central integration point, handling queries and mutations from various client applications.

## Component Dependencies

Sources: [src/main.rs10-17](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/main.rs#L10-L17) [src/graphql/mod.rs1-6](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mod.rs#L1-L6)

This structure demonstrates the dependency flow from the main application entry point to the various components, showing how the system is modularized by domain and responsibility.
