This document details the GraphQL API operations related to projects in the Root system. Projects represent work items associated with club members. This page covers the Project data model, available queries for retrieving project data, and mutations for modifying project data.

For information about member-related operations, see [Member Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.1-member-queries-and-mutations). For attendance tracking, see [Attendance Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.2-attendance-queries-and-mutations).

## Project Data Model

Projects in the Root system are represented by a simple data model that links a project to a specific member.

The `Project` model is defined in the system as a Rust struct that maps to the database table. It contains a unique identifier, a reference to the member who owns the project, and an optional title.

Sources: [src/models/project.rs4-9](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/project.rs#L4-L9) [migrations/20250124095543\_create\_project\_table.sql1-6](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250124095543_create_project_table.sql#L1-L6)

## Database Schema

The Project table's database schema includes a foreign key relationship with the Member table:

The `Project` table includes:

* `project_id`: A serial primary key
* `member_id`: Foreign key referencing the Member table
* `title`: Text field containing the project's name

Sources: [migrations/20250124095543\_create\_project\_table.sql1-6](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/migrations/20250124095543_create_project_table.sql#L1-L6)

## Project Queries

The Root GraphQL API provides two main ways to query project data:

1. Retrieve all projects (via the `projects` query)
2. Retrieve projects for a specific member (via the `projects` field on a Member)

### Query All Projects

The `projects` query retrieves a list of all projects in the system.

This query is implemented in the `ProjectQueries` struct and executes a simple SQL query to fetch all projects from the database.

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/project\_queries.rs11-21](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/project_queries.rs#L11-L21)

### Query Projects by Member

Projects can also be accessed through member queries using the nested `projects` field on a `Member` object:

This query is implemented as a complex object field on the `Member` struct and retrieves all projects associated with that specific member.

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs85-93](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L85-L93)

## Project Mutations

The API currently supports one mutation for projects - creating a new project.

### Create a New Project

The `setProject` mutation allows creating a new project for a member:

This mutation takes a `SetProjectInput` object and returns the newly created `Project`.

Sources: [src/graphql/mutations/project\_mutations.rs13-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/project_mutations.rs#L13-L27) [src/models/project.rs11-15](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/models/project.rs#L11-L15)

## Query and Mutation Flow

The following diagram illustrates how Project queries and mutations flow through the Root system:

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/project\_queries.rs11-21](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/project_queries.rs#L11-L21) [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs85-93](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L85-L93) [src/graphql/mutations/project\_mutations.rs13-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/project_mutations.rs#L13-L27)

## Code Structure

The Project functionality is distributed across several files in the codebase:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/models/project.rs` | Defines the `Project` struct and `SetProjectInput` |
| `src/graphql/queries/project_queries.rs` | Implements the `projects` query |
| `src/graphql/mutations/project_mutations.rs` | Implements the `setProject` mutation |
| `src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs` | Implements the `projects` field on `Member` |
| `migrations/20250124095543_create_project_table.sql` | Database migration creating the Project table |

The code is organized in a modular manner, separating GraphQL resolvers from data models and ensuring clean separation of concerns.

## Integration with Other Entities

Projects in the Root system primarily integrate with Member entities:

The integration between Members and Projects allows clients to:

1. Query all projects in the system
2. Create new projects for specific members
3. Query a member's projects as part of member data

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs85-93](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L85-L93) [src/graphql/queries/project\_queries.rs11-21](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/project_queries.rs#L11-L21) [src/graphql/mutations/project\_mutations.rs13-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/project_mutations.rs#L13-L27)

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

Currently, the Project functionality in Root is fairly basic. Some potential enhancements could include:

1. Adding mutations to update or delete existing projects
2. Supporting additional project fields such as description, status, or deadlines
3. Implementing filtering and pagination for project queries
4. Adding project collaboration features to allow multiple members to work on a project

These enhancements would require extending the data model, adding new GraphQL operations, and updating the database schema.
