This document describes the Docker containerization and deployment process for the Root GraphQL Backend. It covers how the application is packaged into a Docker container, published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), and deployed to production environments. For information about code quality checks and release management, see [Code Quality and Releases](/nitronium-ops/root/6.2-code-quality-and-releases).

## Containerization Overview

The Root GraphQL backend is containerized to ensure consistent deployment across different environments. The containerization process packages the Rust application and its dependencies into a standardized Docker image.

Sources: [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml1-86](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml#L1-L86)

## Dockerfile Structure

The Root GraphQL backend uses a multi-stage Dockerfile to produce an optimized container image. This approach separates the build environment from the runtime environment, resulting in a smaller and more secure final image.

### Build Stage

The build stage compiles the Rust application using the official Rust image. It includes all necessary development dependencies and build tools.

### Runtime Stage

The runtime stage starts with a minimal Debian base image and only includes the compiled binary and runtime dependencies, significantly reducing the image size and attack surface.

Sources: [Cargo.toml1-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/Cargo.toml#L1-L27)

## Container Registry Deployment

The Root backend uses GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for storing and managing container images. This integration with GitHub provides seamless authentication and version management.

### CI/CD Pipeline

When changes are pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically triggers a workflow that builds the Docker image and publishes it to GHCR. This ensures that the latest version of the application is always available for deployment.

Sources: [.github/workflows/lint.yml1-40](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/lint.yml#L1-L40) [.github/workflows/generate-release.yml1-86](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/.github/workflows/generate-release.yml#L1-L86)

## Environment Configuration

The Root backend requires several environment variables to function correctly. These variables control database connections, authentication settings, and other runtime behaviors.

### Environment Variables

The Docker container uses environment variables for runtime configuration. These can be provided at container startup using Docker's `-e` flag or through a docker-compose file.

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/root` |
| `PORT` | Server listening port | `8000` |
| `HMAC_SECRET` | Secret for HMAC validation | `secret_key_value` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS allowed origins | `http://localhost:3000,https://example.com` |

## Database Connection

The Root backend connects to a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. The container needs to be configured with the appropriate connection string to access the database.

Sources: [Cargo.toml12](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/Cargo.toml#L12-L12)

## Running the Container

The Docker container exposes the GraphQL API on the configured port. It can be run directly using the Docker CLI or as part of a more complex orchestration using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

### Docker CLI

### Docker Compose Example

For production deployments, Docker Compose provides a more manageable configuration approach:

## Container Security Considerations

The Root backend container follows security best practices to minimize vulnerabilities:

1. Uses multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
2. Runs as a non-root user within the container
3. Contains only the compiled binary and minimal dependencies
4. Applies regular security updates through the CI/CD pipeline

Sources: [Cargo.toml14-16](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/Cargo.toml#L14-L16)

## Health Monitoring

The container includes health check capabilities that allow orchestration systems to monitor the application status and automatically restart failed instances.

Sources: [Cargo.toml7-9](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/Cargo.toml#L7-L9)

## Integration with Other Services

The Root GraphQL backend container is designed to integrate with other services in the ecosystem, particularly client applications that consume the GraphQL API.

Sources: [Cargo.toml1-27](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/Cargo.toml#L1-L27)

## Deployment Best Practices

When deploying the Root GraphQL backend container, follow these best practices:

1. **Use environment-specific tags**: Avoid using `latest` tag in production environments
2. **Implement proper logging**: Configure the container to send logs to a centralized logging system
3. **Set resource limits**: Define CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Backup strategy**: Ensure the PostgreSQL database has regular backups
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for container health and performance metrics

The Root GraphQL backend is designed to be stateless, making it suitable for horizontal scaling when deployed behind a load balancer.
