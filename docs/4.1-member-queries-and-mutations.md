This document describes the GraphQL queries and mutations related to the Member entity in the Root system. It covers the available operations for retrieving and modifying member data through the GraphQL API. For attendance-related operations, see [Attendance Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.2-attendance-queries-and-mutations), and for project-related operations, see [Project Queries and Mutations](/nitronium-ops/root/4.4-project-queries-and-mutations).

## Overview

Member queries and mutations provide functionality to:

* Retrieve member information with optional filtering
* Create new members in the system
* Access member-related data including attendance records, projects, and status update streaks

These operations form the core of the member management capabilities in the Root GraphQL API.

## Member Queries

The system provides the following query for retrieving member data:

### `members` Query

This query retrieves a list of members, with optional filtering by year and group ID.

**Parameters:**

* `year` (Optional): Filter members by academic year (1-4)
* `group_id` (Optional): Filter members by group ID

**Returns:** A list of `Member` objects

**Example Query:**

The implementation builds a dynamic SQL query based on the provided filters:

```
SELECT * FROM Member WHERE 1=1 
[+ AND year = {year} if provided]
[+ AND group_id = {group_id} if provided]

```

### Complex Object Fields

The `Member` type has several nested fields that can be requested when querying members:

#### `attendance`

Retrieves attendance records for a member.

**Returns:** Array of `AttendanceInfo` objects containing:

* `date`: The attendance date
* `is_present`: Whether the member was present
* `time_in`: Check-in time
* `time_out`: Check-out time

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs48-58](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L48-L58)

#### `attendanceSummary`

Retrieves monthly attendance summaries for a member.

**Returns:** Array of `AttendanceSummaryInfo` objects containing:

* `year`: The year of the summary
* `month`: The month of the summary
* `days_attended`: Number of days attended that month

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs60-71](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L60-L71)

#### `streak`

Retrieves status update streak information for a member.

**Returns:** Array of `StatusUpdateStreakInfo` objects containing:

* `current_streak`: The current consecutive streak
* `max_streak`: The maximum streak achieved

Sources: [src/graphql/queries/member\_queries.rs73-83](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/queries/member_queries.rs#L73-L83)

#### `projects`

Retrieves projects associated with a member.

**Returns:** Array of `Project` objects containing:

* `project_id`: The project identifier
* `title`: The project title

## Member Mutations

The system provides mutations for creating and updating member data:

### `createMember` Mutation

Creates a new member in the system.

**Input:**

* `roll_no`: Student roll number (unique)
* `name`: Member's full name
* `email`: Email address (unique)
* `sex`: Gender (enum: 'M', 'F', 'Other')
* `year`: Academic year (1-4)
* `hostel`: Hostel or residence name
* `mac_address`: MAC address (unique)
* `discord_id`: Discord ID (unique)
* `group_id`: Group identifier

**Returns:** The created `Member` object

**Example Mutation:**

The implementation inserts a new record into the Member table with the current date as the creation timestamp.

## Member Schema Details

The Member table schema defines the structure of member data with the following constraints:

| Column | Type | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| member\_id | SERIAL | PRIMARY KEY |
| roll\_no | VARCHAR(16) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE |
| name | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL |
| email | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE |
| sex | sex\_type (ENUM) | NOT NULL |
| year | INT | NOT NULL, BETWEEN 1 and 4 |
| hostel | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL |
| mac\_address | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE |
| discord\_id | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE |
| group\_id | INT | NOT NULL |
| created\_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP |

* [src/graphql/mutations/member\_mutations.rs](https://github.com/nitronium-ops/root/blob/f2ed7e90/src/graphql/mutations/member_mutations.rs)

## Usage Considerations

When working with Member queries and mutations, keep in mind:

1. Several fields in the Member model are unique (roll\_no, email, mac\_address, discord\_id), so the `createMember` mutation will fail if any of these values already exist in the database.
2. The `year` field must be between 1 and 4, as enforced by the database schema.
3. When querying members, you can filter by year and group\_id, but these filters are optional. If neither is provided, all members will be returned.
4. The complex object fields (attendance, attendanceSummary, streak, projects) allow for efficient nested queries to retrieve related data in a single GraphQL request.
